64-bit Android support is intended - though not guaranteed - to release alongside AM2R 2.0 instead.

```diff
- WARNING: This is NOT intended for players, please use the AM2RLauncher to install the game instead!
```
This utility:
- Patches AM2R 1.5.5's datafile to use Bytecode 16/GameMaker: Studio 1.4.9999.
- Removes deprecated function references.
- Applies a series of bugfix patches.
- Applies a series of optimizations.

The goal of these operations is to:
- Produce a datafile that is compatible with the GameMaker Studio 2.1.5 runner, and thus x64 Android and Linux.
- Produce a datafile with all desired changes for version 1.6.
